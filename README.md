Computer Science 420 Final Project by Michelle Ramiz and Robert Durst. 
This is a program designed to take in textual input and encode it, letting the user choose between a Caesar shift, ROT13, atbash, and Vigenere ciphers. With the key being known for the shift and Vigenere, ciphertext can also be deciphered (no key necessary for ROT13 or atbash). 
We aren't responsible for any use of this code in any unintended purposes.
